#X text 21 196 Audio computation can be turned on and off by sending
messages to the global "pd" object as follows:;
#X msg 55 244 \; pd dsp 1;
#X msg 159 244 \; pd dsp 0;
#X text 73 280 ON;
#X text 177 280 OFF;
#X text 19 366 When DSP is on \, you should hear a tone whose pitch
is A 440 and whose amplitude is 0.05. If instead you are greeted with
silence \, you might want to read the HTML documentation on setting
up audio.;
#X text 18 426 In general when you start a work session with Pd \,
you will want to choose "test audio and MIDI" from the help window
\, which opens a more comprehensive test patch than this one.;

#X text 22 31 Audio computation in Pd is done using "tilde objects"
such as the three below. They use continuous audio streams to intercommunicate
\, and also communicate with other ("control") Pd objects using messages.
;
#X text 19 308 You should see the Pd ("main") window change to reflect
whether audio is on or off. You can also turn audio on and off using
the "audio" menu \, but the buttons are provided as a shortcut.;
